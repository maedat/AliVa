# AliVa; Simple nucleotide variation counter
====
AliVa is a simple counter and visualizer of aligned nucleotide sequence variation. AliVa counts the indel/transition/transversion numbers from a multiple aligned nucleotide sequence file, and visualize the distribution of the variation with multiple plots. Our main purpose is the understanding of variation-enriched region on the aligned sequences. We split the alignment with given window size (default = 50 bp), and calculate the number of variation in each window. The variations will be counted among all pairs of aligned sequences, and raw data will output to "result_rawdata.txt" file, and the mean values will be described on "average.txt" file. The main output plot is "line_all.pdf" which visualize the distribution of the variations.


## Output example

![line_all.pdf](test/line_all.pdf.png)


## Requirement

Python 3.7. (Biopython, pandas, argparse, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)

## Usage
```sh
usage: aliva.py [-h] -f FASTA [-w WIN] [-p]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FASTA, --fasta FASTA
                        File path to a genome sequence file
  -w WIN, --win WIN     window size (bp) (default = 50)
  -p, --plot            Manualy modify the plot with seaborn window


```

## Demo
```sh

aliva.py -f ./test/test.fa 

```
